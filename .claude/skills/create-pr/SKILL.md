# Create or Update PR

Open a pull request for the current branch with a Conventional-Commits
title and an empty body. The repo's `claude-code-review` workflow upserts
the canonical summary into the PR body on every push, so this skill never
authors a description: it creates the PR with no body and leaves the body
for CI, and it never overwrites a body that already exists.

## Apply when
- The user says "open the PR", "push the branch and PR", "make a PR", or
  similar after work is committed.
- The project's gates (lint + tests) have passed locally and the branch
  has commits ahead of `main`.
- Skip if `git status -s` shows uncommitted changes that should be in the
  PR -- ask the user to commit or stash first.

## Inputs to gather
1. `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` — branch name.
2. `git log main..HEAD --oneline` — commits the PR contains.
3. `git diff main...HEAD --stat` — file-level shape of the change.
4. `gh pr view --json number 2>/dev/null` — does a PR exist already?

If `gh pr view` returns "no pull requests found", we'll create with an
empty body. Otherwise the PR already exists and we leave its body alone.

## Title rules

Hard requirements:
- **Conventional Commits shape**: `<type>(<scope>?): <description>`.
- **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `ci`,
  `perf`, `build`. Pick from this fixed set.
- **Scope** (optional, lowercase): the package or area touched, e.g. the
  directory or component name, or `deps` for dependency bumps. Single
  word; multi-word scopes are a smell. Sample existing scopes with
  `git log main --pretty=format:%s | head -20`.
- **Description**: lowercase first letter, imperative or descriptive,
  no trailing punctuation.
- **Length**: aim for ≤ 65 chars total. Hard cap at 72.
- **Same shape as commit titles** in the project — sample
  `git log main --pretty=format:%s | head -20` to verify.

Examples that fit: `feat(api): inline default timeout`,
`fix(server): bound request ctx with command timeout`,
`chore(deps): bump some-dependency to v1.20`.

Anti-patterns to avoid:
- ALL CAPS prefixes ("M4: ..."): drop the milestone tag.
- Multi-clause titles with "and" or `+`: pick the bigger half. If the
  change really is two things, that's a sign it should be two PRs.
- Verbose nouns ("complete the foo resource"): use the verb
  ("complete foo").

## Body

Do not write a PR body. The repo's `claude-code-review` workflow upserts
the canonical summary (a `> [!NOTE]` block delimited by
`<!-- claude-code-review:summary -->` markers) into the PR description on
every push, so authoring one here would only duplicate or fight with it.

Create the PR with an empty body and let CI fill it. If a PR already
exists, leave its body untouched — CI owns it, and a human may have added
prose of their own that must not be clobbered.

## Decision tree

```
Does a PR exist for this branch?
├── No  → gh pr create with generated title and an empty body, then print URL.
└── Yes → Leave the body alone (CI owns the summary; a human may have added
          prose). Print URL only.
```

After the PR exists, **always check CI status** (see below). The point
of opening a PR is to get the change reviewed and merged; surfacing a
red check immediately lets the user fix it before they walk away.

## Commands

Push first, then create the PR with an empty body. Pass `--body ""`
explicitly so `gh` does not drop into an interactive editor.

```bash
# 1. Push (set upstream on first push of this branch)
git push -u origin "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"

# 2. Detect existing PR
PR_NUM=$(gh pr view --json number --jq '.number // empty' 2>/dev/null)

# 3. Create with an empty body when none exists; never touch an existing body
if [ -z "$PR_NUM" ]; then
  gh pr create --title "<generated title>" --body ""
  PR_NUM=$(gh pr view --json number --jq .number)
else
  echo "PR #$PR_NUM already exists; leaving its body to CI."
fi
gh pr view --json url --jq .url
```

If `gh` returns `HTTP 401: Bad credentials`, the operator has a stale
`GITHUB_TOKEN` env var overriding the keychain. Prepend `unset GITHUB_TOKEN`
to the failing command and retry.

## CI status check

After the PR exists (just created OR already-existed), run a quick
status check. CI typically kicks off within a few seconds of the push,
but most pipelines take 1-5 minutes to complete. Two modes:

```bash
# Snapshot: list current state of every check, no waiting.
gh pr checks "$PR_NUM"
```

If any row shows `fail` or `failure`, surface those rows to the user
verbatim and direct them to the failing job's URL (the rightmost
column of `gh pr checks`). Don't try to diagnose the failure from the
skill -- the failing job's logs are the source of truth.

If every row shows `pending` or `queued`, that's expected on a fresh
push. Print the URL with a "checks running" hint. Do NOT block the
skill on completion -- the user can run `gh pr checks --watch` to
follow them.

If every row shows `pass`, say so explicitly. The user shouldn't have
to scroll back to verify.

## What NOT to do
- Don't author a PR body. The `claude-code-review` workflow owns the
  description; anything written here duplicates or fights with it.
- Don't overwrite or edit the body of an existing PR.
- Don't push to `main` directly. Always operate on a feature branch.
- Don't run `git push --force` unless the user explicitly asked.

## After posting

Print the PR URL on its own line so the operator can click through.
